# Doughnut

This is my own personal game engine project. It is very much still under construction and thus contains a lot of code from a different project, as well es unfinished code in general.

## Getting Started

- Make sure to initialise the submodules or clone with `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/TheMejmun/Doughnut`
- You may also need to change the vulkan directory in CMakeLists.txt. 
- As far as I am aware you do not need to do anything for vcpkg to work.
