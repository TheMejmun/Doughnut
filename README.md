# Doughnut

This is my own personal game engine project. It evolved from a uni project and has been rewritten into a general games & graphics framework.

## WIP

This code is under rapid construction. This is in no way an alpha build yet, as many features are practically unusable in the current state.

## Getting Started

You may need to set an environment variable for the Vulkan SDK to work. This is usually handled by the SDK installer.

Other external dependencies are loaded automatically by CMake. This can take some time during the initial setup.
