# Doughnut

This is my own personal game engine project. It evolved from a uni project and has been rewritten into a general games & graphics framework.

## WIP

This code is under rapid construction. This is in no way an alpha build yet, as many features are practically unusable in the current state.

## Getting Started

- Make sure to initialise the git submodules with `git submodule update --init --recursive`
- You may also need to set an environment variable for the Vulkan SDK to work. This is usually handled by the SDK installer.
